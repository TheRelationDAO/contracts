# TheRelationDAO

Build the metaverse social infrastructure.

## Background

Inspired by TheOpenDAO, I began to realize the value of user data on the chain. As one of the essential activities of our daily life, social networking, its social network relationships are also very valuable! TheRelationDAO is committed to building an on-chain transparent social network relationship. Everyone can make further development on the basis of the social network relationship provided by TheRelationDAO to give full play to the value of the social network relationship on the chain, allowing Web3 users to enjoy social networking and gain additional economic benefits!

## Implementation

Every user can mint his own NFT in TheRelationDAO. The NFT includes basic information such as name, avatar, introduction, and Twitter. This basic information is stored on the IPFS network. After obtaining their own NFTs, users can use their own NFTs to follow other people's NFTs, and others can use their own NFTs to follow your NFTs, thus forming a huge on-chain social network.
